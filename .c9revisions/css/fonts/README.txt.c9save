Details available in LICENSE.txt file.\n\n- Usually, it's enough to publish content of LICENSE.txt file somewhere on your\n  site in \"About\" section.\n\n- If your project is open-source, usually, it will be ok to make LICENSE.txt\n  file publically available in your repository.\n\n- Fonts, used in Fontello, don't require to make clickable links on your site.\n  But any kind of additional authors crediting is welcome.\n================================================================================\n\n\nComments on archive content\n---------------------------\n\n- /font/* - fonts in different formats\n\n- /css/*  - different kinds of css, for all situations. Should be ok with \n  twitter bootstrap. Also, you can skip <i> style and assign icon classes\n  directly to text elements, if you don't mind about IE7.\n\n- demo.html - demo file, to show your webfont content\n\n- LICENSE.txt - license info about source fonts, used to build your one.\n\n- config.json - keeps your settings. You can import it back to fontello anytime,\n  to continue your work\n\n\nWhy so many CSS files ?\n-----------------------\n\nBecause we like to fit all your needs :)\n\n- basic file, <your_font_name>.css - is usually enougth, in contains @font-face\n  and character codes definition\n\n- *-ie7.css - if you need IE7 support, but still don't wish to put char codes\n  directly into html\n\n- *-codes.css and *-ie7-codes.css - if you like to use your own @font-face\n  rules, but still wish to benefit of css generation. That can be very\n  convenient for automated assets build systems. When you need to update font -\n  no needs to manually edit files, just override old version with archive\n  content. See fontello source codes for example.\n\n- *-embedded.css - basic css file, but with embedded WOFF font, to avoid\n  CORS issues in Firefox and IE9+, when fonts are hosted on the separate domain.\n  We strongly recommend to resolve this issue by `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\n  server headers. But if you ok with dirty hack - this file is for you. Note,\n  that data url moved to separate @font-face to avoid problems with <IE9, when\n  string is too long.\n\n- animate.css - use it to get ideas about spinner rotation animation.\n\n\nAttention for server setup\n--------------------------\n\nYou MUST setup server to reply with proper `mime-types` for font files. In other\ncase, some browsers will fail to show fonts.\n\nUsually, `apache` already has necessary settings, but `nginx` and other\nwebservers should be tuned. Here is list of mime types for our file extentions:\n\n- `application/vnd.ms-fontobject` - eot\n- `application/x-font-woff` - woff\n- `application/x-font-ttf` - ttf\n- `image/svg+xml` - svg\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2888}]],"length":2888}
